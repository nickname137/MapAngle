Privacy Policy for MapAngle
Effective Date: 05/01/2025

MapAngle is a lightweight Chrome extension that overlays a movable protractor on Google Maps to help users visually measure azimuth angles. We take your privacy seriously and want to be transparent about how we handle your data.

1. Data Collection
MapAngle does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension runs entirely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers.

No personal information is collected.

No browsing activity is tracked.

No map data or click events are sent outside your browser.

2. Permissions
The extension only operates on https://www.google.com/maps/* and requires access to inject the protractor image and respond to your key and click inputs. It does not access or monitor any other websites.

3. Third-Party Services
MapAngle does not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or external APIs.

4. Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to contact the developer at: memecoinjs@gmail.com
